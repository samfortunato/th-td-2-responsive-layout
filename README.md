# Responsive Layout

## Techdegree Project 2

This is the GitHub repository for the second project for the Front End Web Development Techdegree at Treehouse.

### Info 

This is a responsive layout that was created based off of provided image mock-ups. Mobile, tablet, and desktop versions were created.

Proper HTML practices such as including descriptive meta tags and focusing on semantics were used.

Creating the webpage included aligning items different based on what the screen size was (a cornerstone of responsive design), and hiding and showing items depending on the screen size.

Slight adjustments were made to the layout according to my own tastes. I added an extra "Skills" section to the website, which includes a list of skills. I thought of an original design for the section, and applied custom styling.

Both the HTML and CSS are valid, according to W3C's validator services.
